###### The Metropolitan Museum of Art
The Metropolitan Museum of Art is **home to thousands of historical artworks** and artifacts from around the world. New York City is fortunate to have such an insitution; there are few places in the world that contain such magnificent works. The exhibits that must see in the museum are: The death of Socrates, **The Denial of saint Peter**, Young Mother Sewing, A human-headed winged lion(lamassu), Venus Italica, The Sphinx of Hatshepsut, **Interior of saint Peter's**, Dancing Celestial Deity(Devata).
